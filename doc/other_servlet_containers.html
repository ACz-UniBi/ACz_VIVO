            <p>
                The default installation process for VIVO tells how to build and deploy VIVO
                into a Tomcat servlet container. This document tells how to build VIVO so it can be used
                in any servlet container that supports the Java Servlet 2.4 Specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process will produce:
                <ul>
                    <li>a WAR file for the VIVO application,</li>
                    <li>a WAR file for the Solr application,</li>
                    <li>a TAR file for the Solr home directory, configured to work with VIVO.</li>
                </ul>
                These artifacts can then be installed into a servlet container (or more than one),
                and configured to work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The configuration includes the customary <code>runtime.properties</code> file in the
                Vitro home directory. It also requires items that tell the VIVO application
                and the Solr application how to find their respective home directories. These
                items are specific to the servlet container. However, they
                are described so you can translate them to your container of choice.
            </p>
            <p><em>
                Note: earlier releases of VIVO used a single <code>deploy.properties</code> file
                to specify both build properties and runtime properties. This file has now been
                split into <code>build.properties</code> and <code>runtime.properties</code> 
            </em></p>
            <p>
               Start by reading the customary <a href="install.html">
               instructions for installing VIVO</a>, taking note of the Tomcat-specific sections.
               This document will consist mostly of comparisons to those instructions.

            </toc>

            <h3 id="before_build">1. Before the build</h3>
            	<h4>Required software</h4>
            	<p>
            	    Tomcat is not required. You can use any servlet container 
            	    that supports the Java Servlet 2.4 Specification.
            	</p>
            	
            	<h4>Logging properties for VIVO</h4>
            	<p>
            	    The logging properties for VIVO are determined by the file 
            	    <code>[vitro-core]/webapp/config/default.log4j.properties</code>.
            	    <em>(Note: if <code>debug.log4j.properties</code> exists, 
            	    it will override <code>default.log4j.properties</code>).</em>  
            	</p>
            	<p> 
            	    Notice how the location of the log file is determined:
            	    <pre>log4j.appender.AllAppender.File=$${catalina.home}/logs/${webapp.name}.all.log</pre>
            	    The filename of the log file is based on the <code>webapp.name</code> property
            	    found in the <code>build.properties</code> file. This substitution is made during
            	    the build process. The path to the log file is based on the system property 
            	    <code>catalina.home</code> which is set by Tomcat at runtime.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	    You will likely want to change this line -- making it an absolute path, or
            	    basing it on some other system property. 
            	    Notice that <code>ant</code> will substitute properties such as 
            	    <code>${webapp.name}</code> during the build process. The name of a system property
            	    requires a second dollar sign, e.g. <code>$${catalina.home}</code> to protect it from <code>ant</code>.
            	    <code>Ant</code> will remove the second dollar sign, but will not try to substitute
            	    a value for the property. At runtime, when Log4J reads the properties file,
            	    it will substitute the matching system property.
            	</p>

            	<h4>Logging properties for Solr</h4>
            	<p>
            	    The logging properties for Solr are determined by the file 
            	    <code>[vitro-core]/webapp/config/solr/logging.properties</code>.
            	</p>
            	<p> 
            	    As with VIVO, the location of the log file is based on the system property 
            	    <code>catalina.home</code> which is set by Tomcat at runtime.
            	    <pre>org.apache.juli.FileHandler.directory = ${catalina.base}/logs</pre>
            	    Note that only one dollar sign is used, since Ant does not attempt to
            	    substitute properties in this file.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	    The syntax of the Solr logging properties is different from the syntax for VIVO.
            	    This is because VIVO uses Log4J as a back end for the Commons Logging framework,
            	    while Solr uses JULI as a back end for SLF4J.
            	</p>
                <p><em>
                    Note: Solr is able to do this because Tomcat provides the JULI framework by default.
                    Other servlet containers may require JULI to be installed. If you encounter this as an issue, please
                    share your experience with the VIVO Development mailing list (<code>vivo-dev-all@lists.sourceforge.net</code>), 
                    so we can improve our distribution.
                </em></p>

                <h4>The <code>build.properties</code> file</h4>
                <p>
                    The standard installation instructions specify that these properties 
                    are required in <code>build.properties</code>
                    <ul>
       	        		<li><code>vitro.core.dir</code></li>
       	        		<li><code>webapp.name</code></li>
       	        		<li><code>tomcat.home</code></li>
       	        		<li><code>vitro.home</code> <em>-- note that this was <code>vitro.home.directory</code>
       	        		in previous releases</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    However, if you are building with <code>ant distribute</code>, then only these are required:
                    <ul>
       	        		<li><code>vitro.core.dir</code></li>
       	        		<li><code>webapp.name</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>tomcat.home</code> is ignored by the <code>distribute</code> target. 
                    You may choose to specify <code>vitro.home</code> in <code>build.properties</code>, 
                    or later, when you deploy VIVO (see <a href="#deploy_vivo">Deploying VIVO</a>).
                    If you specify <code>vitro.home</code> in <code>build.properties</code>, you can override 
                    it when you deploy, but you will receive a warning when VIVO starts, saying that <code>vitro.home</code>
                    has been specified twice.
                </p>

            <h3 id="build_script">2. Running the build script</h3>
                <p>
                    To build VIVO for other servlet containers, you will use one of these commands:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>ant distribute</code>  -- to incorporate changes since your previous build.</li>
                        <li><code>ant clean distribute</code> -- to do a full build from scratch</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The build will produce a file named <code>distribution.tar.gz</code>, in the <code>.build</code> 
                    sub-directory of your VIVO distribution directory. This compressed archive contains these files:
         	        <ul>
         	            <li><code>vivo.war</code> -- a WAR file for the main VIVO application.</li>
         	            <li><code>vivosolr.war</code> -- a WAR file for the Solr application.</li>
         	            <li><code>solrhome.tar</code> -- a Solr home directory that is configured for use with VIVO.</li>
         	        </ul>
         	        The WAR files will be deployed to your servlet container. They may be renamed as desired when deployed.
         	        The TAR file will be unpacked to become your Solr home directory.
                </p>

            <h3 id="deploy_solr">3. Deploying Solr</h3>
                <p>
                    The Solr application is packaged in <code>vivosolr.war</code> 
                    (see <a href="#build_script">Running the build script</a>). Deploy this file
                    as required by your servlet container. The filename is not significant, 
                    and the file may be renamed as required by your container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Solr home directory is packaged in <code>solrhome.tar</code> 
                    (see <a href="#build_script">Running the build script</a>). Create a Solr
                    home directory on your machine, and unpack this file into that 
                    directory. It is customary to use a <code>solr</code> sub-directory in your
                    Vitro home directory, but this is not required. Note that the Solr home directory
                    will contain VIVO's search index, so it may grow to be quite large.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    You must tell Solr where to find the home directory. You can use one of two
                    methods:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Set the sytem property <code>solr.solr.home</code> to the path of
                        your Solr home directory.</li>
                        <li>Set a JNDI value at <code>java:comp/env/solr/home</code> to the 
                        path of your Solr home directory. For servlet containers, a JNDI
                        prefix of <code>java:comp/env/</code> is assumed for all environment 
                        entries, so you will likely just specify a value for <code>solr/home</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Which of these methods should you use? In general, it is easier to set a
                    system property than an environment entry. However, a system property
                    applies across the entire servlet container. If you want to deploy
                    two instances of Solr in the same container, you will need to use environment
                    entries to give each instance its own home directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Solr application must be authorized to read and write to the Solr home directory.
                </p>
                

            <h3 id="deploy_vivo">4. Deploying VIVO</h3>
                <p>
                    The VIVO application is packaged in <code>vivo.war</code> 
                    (see <a href="#build_script">Running the build script</a>). Deploy this file
                    as required by your servlet container. The filename is not significant, 
                    and the file may be renamed as required by your container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You must create a Vitro home directory.
                    You must create a <code>runtime.properties</code> file in the Vitro home directory.
                    The contents of this file are exactly as specified in the standard installaion 
                    instructions. Pay attention to the value of <code>vitro.local.solr.url</code>. 
                    This must point to the base of the Solr application, as you have deployed it.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    You must tell VIVO where to find the Vitro home directory. 
                    If you did not specify this in <code>build.properties</code>, you can use 
                    one of two methods:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Set the sytem property <code>vitro.vitro.home</code> to the path of
                        your Vitro home directory.</li>
                        <li>Set a JNDI value at <code>java:comp/env/vitro/home</code> to the 
                        path of your Vitro home directory. For servlet containers, a JNDI
                        prefix of <code>java:comp/env/</code> is assumed for all environment 
                        entries, so you will likely just specify a value for <code>vitro/home</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Which of these methods should you use? In general, it is easier to set a
                    system property than an environment entry. However, a system property
                    applies across the entire servlet container. If you want to deploy
                    two instances of VIVO in the same container, you will need to use environment
                    entries to give each instance its own home directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The VIVO application must be authorized to read and write to the Vitro home directory.
                </p>
                <p><em>
                    Note: Session object in VIVO are not serializable, and therefore cannot be
                    made persistent. The standard build process tells Tomcat not to attempt to 
                    persist Sessions. You may need to set a similar configuration option in your 
                    servlet container.
