                This document provides a short description of the steps involved in 
                upgrading your installation of VIVO from Version 1.3 to Version 1.4.  
                This and other documentation can be found on the <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">support page</a>

            <p>
                If you need to do a fresh install, please consult the VIVO Release V1.4 Installation 
                Guide found on <a href="http://vivoweb.org/support">vivoweb.org</a>
                or the install.html file located in the <code>doc</code>
                directory of the VIVO source code distribution. The installation document also has a 
                list of the required software and versions (there are no new hardware  
                or software requirements for V1.4).

            <p>
                Please ensure that backups are created of the: 
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>
                    Tomcat webapps directory 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Original source directory 
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The upgrade process is similar to the original install process 
                with  
                the following EXCEPTIONS: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you are still in RDB mode, it is required that you move 
                    your  
                    triple store to SDB while still at V1.2 (see <a href="#triple_store">Triple
                        Store</a>
                    info below).&nbsp; 
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    DO NOT reinstall MySQL or recreate the MySQL database. Please 
                    ensure that you back-up the MySQL database. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is not necessary to add RDF data. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    First-time login of the root account after the upgrade  
                    process is complete will use the password previously set, NOT the 
                    default password used on the first login after the initial  
                    installation. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first time Apache Tomcat starts up after the upgrade, it 
                    will initiate a process that modifies the knowledge base to align the  
                    data with the revised ontology. See the section on the <a href="#ontology">Ontology Upgrade</a>
                    below for more information.

                            RDF resources available for harvest using linked data. Requests for RDF
                            resource URIs redirect to HTML or RDF representations as specified by
                            the client. To make this possible, VIVO's default namespace must have a
                            certain structure and begin with the public web address of the VIVO
                            installation. For example, if the web address of a VIVO installation is
                            "http://vivo.example.edu/" the default namespace must be set to
                            "http://vivo.example.edu/individual/" in order to support linked data.

                    Changes to the VIVO core ontology may require corresponding

                    changes. Not all of the modifications that may be required can be 
                    automated, so manual review of the knowledge base is recommended after

                    you assign in the "Site Information" form under the <strong>Site Admin</strong>
                    area will be 
                    inserted into the "Terms of Use" statement.  If you want to edit the text content more than just

                    Be sure to make the changes in your source files and deploy them to your tomcat so you don't lose 
                    your changes next time you deploy for another reason.
