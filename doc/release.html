            VIVO Release 1.4 incorporates changes to the search 
            indexing, user accounts, menu management, ontology, and visualizations, and begins  
            integration of VIVO Harvester functions with VIVO's own ingest tools.

            <p>
                VIVO 1.4 will feature notable improvements to the local search, primarily to 
                improve relevance ranking but also to boost the influence of semantic relationships  
                in the search. This will improve recall by including text from related resources 
                (e.g., adding a person's grant and publication titles to his or her search entry)  
                and by boosting overall relevance ranking based on the number and nature of 
                connections from one individual to others.
            </p>
            <p>
                VIVO is now using Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) in place of 
                Apache Lucene to improve indexing and faceting of search results. The migration  
                to Solr also aligns the local search with the VIVO multi-site search site under 
                development for release prior to the 2011 VIVO Conference.
            </p>
            <h4 id="Authorization">Authorization</h4>
            <p>
                Release 1.4 provides an entirely new model of authorization within the 
                VIVO application to allow more granular control over system 
                configuration and editing. The first phase of the new user account  
                interface is included in V1.4. This interface provides a user search, a 
                root acount, and password reset functionality where the password gets  
                emailed to the user. The next phase will provide the ability to create 
                new roles. 
            </p>
            <h4 id="Menu management">Menu management</h4>
            <p>
                The menus across the top of the site (Home, People, Organizations, 
                Research, Events) can now be managed in a web form instead of editing  
                an RDF file. In addition to making site management much easier, 
                form-based editing also allows more control over what classes of data  
                are displayed and provides a mechanism to limit certain menu pages to 
                content identified as internal to the institution. 
            </p>

            <p>
                While less directly visible to the public, version 1.4 also includes 
                additional changes focused directly on supporting open source community  
                involvement in extending and customizing VIVO. The development team 
                began a year ago to transition VIVO&#39;s code base away from Java Server  
                Pages to the FreeMarker page templating system that much more cleanly 
                separates internal application programming logic from page display. 
            </p>
            <h4 id="Visualization">Visualization</h4>
            <p>
                The visualization team has implemented a Map of Science visualization,
                which allows users to visually explore the scientific strengths of a
                university, school, department, or person in the VIVO instance. Users
                will be able to see where an organization or person&#39;s interests lay
                across 13 major scientific disciplines or 554 sub-disciplines, and will 
                be able to see how these disciplines and sub-disciplines interrelate 
                with one another on the map of science. Wireframes and design  
                documentation for upcoming enhanced versions of the Map of Science 
                visualization have already been developed; the Map of Science  
                visualization will most likely be in the form of a PDF that a user can 
                download. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Several visualization also now provide a caching feature that improves 
                performance after the initial processing. 
            </p>
            <h4 id="QR Codes">QR Codes</h4>
            <p>
                Pages for people in VIVO now have an icon for displaying QR codes to allow 
                capturing names and available contact information on mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h4 id="Harvester Integration">Harvester Integration</h4>
            <p>
                VIVO sites have the option with Release 1.4 of coordinating the configuration 
                of VIVO and the Harvester to enable many Harvester functions to be initiated  
                from the VIVO Ingest Tools menu in support of more unified and centralized 
                management for data ingest.

                <li>
                    expanded support for intellectual property (patents) (it was 
                    there as stub before but didn't allow common things such as assignee  
                    and issuer)

                <li>

                    expanded shared geographical instance data vocabulary to include 
                    the 50 U.S. states

            <p>
                Responses to linked data requests have been enhanced to include 
                additional context about any individual, in working toward a goal of  
                being able to provide all the data in a person's profile available as 
                RDF via a single web request.
