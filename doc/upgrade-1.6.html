            <h3 id="preparation">I. Before Performing the Upgrade</h3>
            <br/>
                Create backups of: 
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>
                    The VIVO distribution directory (which contains the source for VIVO 1.5 or VIVO 1.5.1)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The VIVO home directory (pointed to by your deploy.properties file)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The webapps directory in Tomcat 
                </li>
                <li>
                    MySQL database (most people use mysqldump to create the backup) 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The upgrade process is similar to the initial install process 
                with  
                the following exceptions: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You do not need to reinstall MySQL or recreate the MySQL database. Please 
                    backup your MySQL database as noted above. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    First-time login of the root account after the upgrade  
                    process is complete will use the password previously set (not the 
                    default password used on the first login after the initial  
                    installation.) 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first time Apache Tomcat starts up after the upgrade, an automated 
                    process will modify the knowledge base to align the  
                    data with any ontology updates made for the new release. See the section on the <a href="#kbm">Knowledge Base Migration</a>
                    below for more information. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="changes">II. Noteworthy Changes</h3>
            	<ul>
            	    <li>
                	    <h4 id="more_portable">VIVO becomes more portable</h4>
             	        <p>
             	        	The VIVO build script now includes a <code>distribute</code> target that will produce
             	        	a file called <code>distribution.tar.gz</code>. This compressed archive contains
             	        	these files:
             	        	<ol>
             	        	    <li><code>vivo.war</code> -- a WAR file for the main VIVO application.</li>
             	        	    <li><code>vivosolr.war</code> -- a WAR file for the Solr application.</li>
             	        	    <li><code>solrhome.tar</code> -- a Solr home directory that is configured for use with VIVO.</li>
             	        	</ol>
             	        	These files can be used with Tomcat, or with any container that supports 
             	        	the Java Servlet 2.4 Specification.
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	            To permit this portability, the <code>deploy.properties</code> file
             	            has been split in two. <code>build.properties</code> contains only the properties
             	            that are required for building VIVO. <code>runtime.properties</code>, 
             	            which must be created in the Vitro home directory, contains the properties
             	            that VIVO uses while running.
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	        	If you are building to <code>deploy</code> to Tomcat (as with previous releases),
             	        	then <code>build.properties</code> must contain these properties:
             	        	<ul>
             	        		<li><code>vitro.core.dir</code></li>
             	        		<li><code>webapp.name</code></li>
             	        		<li><code>tomcat.home</code></li>
             	        		<li><code>vitro.home</code> <em>-- note that this was <code>vitro.home.directory</code>
             	        		in previous releases</em></li>
             	        	</ul>
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	        	If you are building to <code>distribute</code>, the <code>build.properties</code>
             	        	file requires only these properties:
             	        	<ul>
             	        		<li><code>vitro.core.dir</code></li>
             	        		<li><code>webapp.name</code></li>
             	        	</ul>
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="solr_insecure">Solr is no longer secured</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            In previous releases, Solr was deployed to Tomcat with a <code>RemoteAddrValve</code>
             	            that would only permit access from certain IP addresses. 
             	            Acceptable IP addresses were those which matched the regular expression pattern in
             	            the <code>vitro.local.solr.ipaddress.mask</code> property.
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	            This has been removed because:
             	            <ul>
             	                <li>It caused repeated problems for sites who were experimenting with VIVO.</li>
             	                <li>It was not standards-based, but specific to Tomcat.</li>
             	                <li>It was redundant. Production instances of VIVO are 
             	                usually hidden behind a firewall and accessed through an Apache Http server.</li>
             	            </ul>
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	            Sites that need to secure Solr are now left to their own devices.
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="log4j_properties">Log4J properties file renamed</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            In previous releases, the properties file for the VIVO logging system
             	            was called <code>default.log4j.properties</code>. In release 1.6, this
             	            file has been renamed to <code>log4j.properties</code>. This is so the 
             	            developers and implementers will know where to look for the file.
             	        </p>
             	        <p>
             	            Note that <code>debug.log4j.properties</code>, if present, will still 
             	            override the default.
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="tabMenu">Property groups now displayed in a tab format, including a "View All" tab</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            With release 1.6, the property group menu bar that was used on profile pages has been replaced 
             	            by java script enabled tabs. When clicked, each property group tab will display the properties 
             	            within that group while the contents of the previously displayed group will be hidden. The array of
             	            tabs also includes a "View All" tab that, when clicked, displays the contents of all the property groups. 
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="sparqlDataGetters">Class-specific SPARQL Query Data Getters</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            The VIVO software now supports the development of SPARQL query data getters that can be associated 
             	            with specific ontological classes. These data getters, in turn, can be accessed within Freemarker 
             	            templates to provide richer content on VIVO profile pages. For example, the profile page for an academic 
             	            department lists only the names of the faculty within that department and their titles, but with a SPARQL 
             	            query data getter it is now possible to extend the faculty information to display all of the faculty 
             	            members' research areas. Refer to this wiki page for details on how to use class-specific SPARQL query 
             	            data getters: 
             	            <code>https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Enriching+VIVO+Content+Using+SPARQL+Query+Data+Getters</code>.
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="foafPersonTemplate">The foaf:Person template has been re-located.</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            The template individual--foaf-person.ftl has been moved to the "templates" subdirectory in the wilma 
             	            theme directory (vivo/themes/wilma/templates). If your installation has a customized version of 
             	            individual--foaf-person.ftl, ensure that it is located in the templates subdirectory in your installation's 
             	            theme directory or, if your installation does not have it's own theme directory, in the 
             	            <code>themes/wilma/templates subdirectory</code>.
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="multiple">Multiple foaf:Person Profile Pages</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            VIVO now supports multiple profile pages for foaf:Persons. This feature, which is optional so installations 
             	            can continue to use just the individual--foaf-person.ftl template, currently consists of two profile page 
             	            types: a standard view, which is a redesigned version of the foaf:Person template in previous releases; and 
             	            a quick view, which emphasizes the individual's own web page presence while providing summary VIVO information, 
             	            such as current positions and research areas. The profile quick view requires the use of a web service that 
             	            captures images of web pages. <strong>This web service is not included with the VIVO software.</strong> An 
             	            installation will either have to develop their own service or use a third-party service, usually for a small 
             	            fee depending on the number of images served. (Examples of these services include WebShotsPro, Thumbalizr and 
             	            Websnapr.) For more information on how to implement multiple profile page views, refer to this wiki page: 
             	            <code>https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Multiple+foaf%3APerson+Profile+Pages</code>.
             	        </p>

                	    <h4 id="homePage">Home Page Re-design</h4>
             	        <p>
             	            For Release 1.6 the VIVO Home Page has been redesigned. The Search field beneath the "welcome" text now 
             	            allows the user to limit the results of a search to a specific class group, such as people, organizations, 
             	            etc. In addition, the browse-by-class-group display has been removed from the Home Page and replaced by 
             	            multiple features, which include: a list of four randomly selected faculty members, including their titles 
             	            and thumbnail images; a display of statistical data about the VIVO installation, such as the number of people, 
             	            activities and organizations; and, <a href="#optionalMap">optionally</a> a global map showing researchers' 
             	            areas of geographic focus.
             	        </p>

                <p>
                    1. Download the new distribution file and unpack it into a new

                    they may be a useful reference if questions come up about your 1.6 VIVO data after deployment, 
                    you should save them aside.
                    The logs are created in the Tomcat <code>webapps/vivo/WEB-INF directory</code>:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <code>ontologies/update/logs/knowledgeBaseUpdate.(timestamp).log</code>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        A log of a summary of updates that were made to the knowledge 
                        base. This file should end with "Finished knowledge base migration". 
                        If this file contains any warnings they should be reviewed with your 
                        implementation team representative to see whether any corrective action needs to be taken. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <code>ontologies/update/logs/knowledgeBaseUpdate.(timestamp).error.log</code>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        A log of errors that were encountered during the upgrade 
                        process. This file should be empty if the upgrade was successful. If any errors are encountered
                        you will need to rerun the knowledge base migration.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    9. Load the About Page .N3 file (optional).  Release 1.6 provides an "about VIVO" page that is editable 
                    through the GUI, using the Page Management functionality. If your installation has a customized version 
                    of the About Page and you do not need to have it accessible via Page Management, then skip this step. 
                    Otherwise, here are the instructions for loading the About Page .N3 file:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Once the VIVO application is running, go to the Site Admin page and click the "Ingest Tools"
                            link under Advanced Data Tools.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From the Ingest Menu click the "Manage Jena Tools" link, and then click the "RDB Models" button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Locate the "vitro-kb-displayMetadata" model and click the "load RDF data" button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click the "Browse" button to upload the file from your computer and select the aboutPage.n3 file
                            located here in the VIVO source: <code>productMods/WEB-INF/ontologies/app/aboutPage.n3</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Select N3 as the file type from the drop-down list and then click the "Load Data" button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Restart tomcat.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your installation has a customized version of the About Page, but you would like to make its content
                    editable through the GUI, follow the above steps and then use Page Management to update the fixed HTML
                    content.
                </p>
 
                <h3 id="#kbm">IV. Knowledge Base Migration</h3>
                
                                <p>
                    Changes to the VIVO core ontology may require corresponding 
                    modifications to the knowledge base instance data and ontology annotations.
                    When VIVO first starts up following the upgrade, it will 
                    initiate a process to examine the knowledge base and apply necessary  
                    changes. The knowledge base migration process for release 1.6 will make
                    the following types of changes: 
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                    	BOGUS CHANGES
                    </dt>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        Annotation property default values 
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        If a site has modified the value of a vitro annotation (such as  
                        displayRankAnnot or displayLimitAnnot) so that it is no longer using 
                        the default, then that setting will be left unchanged. 
                        <br>
                        If a site is using the default value of a vitro annotation, and the 
                        default has been changed in the new version of the ontology, then the  
                        new default value will be propagated to the knowledge base. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    In addition to the logs described in <strong>step 8</strong> of the <a href="#upgrade_process">previous section</a>, the knowledge base migration
                    process will log copies of all additions and deletions that were made to the knowledge base in the following files:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <code>webapps/vivo/WEB-INF/ontologies/update/changedData/removedData.n3</code>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        An N3 file containing all the statements that were removed from the knowledge base. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        An N3 file containing all the statements that were added to the knowledge base. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                
                <h3 id="termsofuse">V. Review the VIVO Terms of Use</h3>
                <p>
                    VIVO comes with a "Terms of Use" statement linked from the footer.  The "Site Name" 
                    you assign in the "Site Information" form under the <strong>Site Admin</strong>
                    area will be 
                    inserted into the "Terms of Use" statement.  If you want to edit the text content more than just 
                    the "Site Name", the file can be found here:<pre>[vivo_source_dir]/vitro-core/webapp/web/templates/freemarker/body/termsOfUse.ftl</pre>
                    Be sure to make the changes in your source files and deploy them to your tomcat so you don't lose 
                    your changes next time you deploy for another reason.
                </p>
