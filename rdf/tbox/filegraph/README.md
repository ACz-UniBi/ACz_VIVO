I believe this directory is where you would add serialized RDF to be automatically loaded when VIVO bootstraps. 

@brianjlowe does a great job of describing these files, and pointing out some highlights. 
I did a poor job of capturing this information in realtime, but this pull request is my
bookmark to follow up.

Action Items:
- [ ] capture highlights covered by @brianjlowe in #vivoifest15 session 
- [ ] identify best place to document all of the existing files in this directory, e.g. 
a table in this Markdown doc versus in the files themselves?
